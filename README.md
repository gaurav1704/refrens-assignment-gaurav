This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, the scripts that you need to run to use all the functionallities are:

### `npm start`

Runs the client part of the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the client part of the app.
Launches the server code using nodemon(for auto restart when any change to the files are detected).\
The server uses the 3001 port to serve the requests made by the client
